Some issues through user testing...

- A user can't join in mid game and have the correct state.
- A user should be able to join a game via a link.
- I want a UI where people can jump into tables (see how many people are playing)
- 'Start game' button is not disabled/enabled when it should be.
- When everyone leaves a game, it must be destroyed, or set to default.
