Some issues through user testing...

- A user when they join mid game cannot see all the words found for this round.
- A user should be able to join a game via a link (without the user encoded in it.)
- I want a UI where people can jump into tables (see how many people are playing)

- Reorder when people jump ahead of others when typing in words.
- Scroll the list as words get updated.
