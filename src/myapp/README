Some issues through user testing...

- A user should be able to join a game via a link (without the user encoded in it.)
- I want a UI where people can jump into tables (see how many people are playing)

- Reorder when people jump ahead of others when typing in words.

- Handle Q (render as qu and handle with graph search somehow)
- Use red and blue colors for bonus points.
- Come up with a better word generator.

- Enable chat with other players.
