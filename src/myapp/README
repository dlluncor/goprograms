Some issues through user testing...

- A user should be able to join a game via a link (without the user encoded in it.)
- I want a UI where people can jump into tables (see how many people are playing)

- Reorder when people jump ahead of others when typing in words.

- B/c when people exit is flaky in terms of deleting the state of the game, we 
- can use the LastRoundStarted - Now to determine whether the game should be
- over. Needs to be round 4.

- Time needs to be shown as 1:30 not 90.
- Exiting still does not seem to reset the game properly...
