Some issues through user testing...

- A user can't join in mid game and have the correct state.
- When a user leaves, we don't clear their user entry/points/token.
- A user should be able to join a game via a link.
- I want a UI where people can jump into tables (see how many people are playing)
- 'Start game' button is not disabled/enabled when it should be.
